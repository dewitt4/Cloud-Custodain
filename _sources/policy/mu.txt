Mu - Lambda Lifecycle Management
--------------------------------

For full Lambda lifecycle management we built Mu. We needed the ability to
create all the resources associated to a given Custodian policy. These resources
can include the event sources for the Lambda functions, such as, Cloud Watch
Events, Scheduled Events, or Cloud Config. We also needed the ability to manage
the different versions of the policy and to not keep updating the lambda
functions during every Custodian run. Mu will evaluate if a policy has
changed by comparing the compiled lambda function to the current Lambda
function. Mu will also update the event sources if the policy has been
updated. Mu can also be used independently for managing lambda functions
with event sources.
