.. _aws.security-group.filters.default-vpc:

default-vpc
+++++++++++
Filter that returns any security group that exists within the default vpc

:example:

.. code-block:: yaml

        policies:
          - name: security-group-default-vpc
            resource: security-group
            filters:
              - default-vpc

.. container:: toggle

  .. code-block:: yaml

    properties:
      type:
        enum:
        - default-vpc
    required:
    - type


.. _aws.security-group.filters.diff:

diff
++++
Compute the diff from the current resource to a previous version.

A resource matches the filter if a diff exists between the current
resource and the selected revision.

Utilizes config as a resource revision database.

Revisions can be selected by date, against the previous version, and
against a locked version (requires use of is-locked filter).

.. container:: toggle

  

  .. raw:: html
     
    <div class="header docutils container" style=""></div>

  .. code-block:: yaml

    properties:
      selector:
        enum:

        - date
        - locked
      selector_value:
        type: string
      type:
        enum:
        - diff
    required:
    - type


.. _aws.security-group.filters.egress:

egress
++++++
Filter for verifying security group ingress and egress permissions

All attributes of a security group permission are available as
value filters.

If multiple attributes are specified the permission must satisfy
all of them. Note that within an attribute match against a list value
of a permission we default to or.

If a group has any permissions that match all conditions, then it
matches the filter.

Permissions that match on the group are annotated onto the group and
can subsequently be used by the remove-permission action.

We have specialized handling for matching `Ports` in ingress/egress
permission From/To range. The following example matches on ingress
rules which allow for a range that includes all of the given ports.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    Ports: [22, 443, 80]

As well for verifying that a rule only allows for a specific set of ports
as in the following example. The delta between this and the previous
example is that if the permission allows for any ports not specified here,
then the rule will match. ie. OnlyPorts is a negative assertion match,
it matches when a permission includes ports outside of the specified set.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    OnlyPorts: [22]

For simplifying ipranges handling which is specified as a list on a rule
we provide a `Cidr` key which can be used as a value type filter evaluated
against each of the rules. If any iprange cidr match then the permission
matches.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    IpProtocol: -1
    FromPort: 445

We also have specialized handling for matching self-references in
ingress/egress permissions. The following example matches on ingress
rules which allow traffic its own same security group.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    SelfReference: True

As well for assertions that a ingress/egress permission only matches
a given set of ports, *note* OnlyPorts is an inverse match.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: egress
    OnlyPorts: [22, 443, 80]

  - type: egress
    Cidr:
      value_type: cidr
      op: in
      value: x.y.z

`Cidr` can match ipv4 rules and `CidrV6` can match ipv6 rules.  In
this example we are blocking global inbound connections to SSH or
RDP.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    Ports: [22, 3389]
    Cidr:
      value:
        - "0.0.0.0/0"
        - "::/0"
      op: in

`SGReferences` can be used to filter out SG references in rules.
In this example we want to block ingress rules that reference a SG
that is tagged with `Access: Public`.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    SGReferences:
      key: "tag:Access"
      value: "Public"
      op: equal

We can also filter SG references based on the VPC that they are
within. In this example we want to ensure that our outbound rules
that reference SGs are only referencing security groups within a
specified VPC.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: egress
    SGReferences:
      key: 'VpcId'
      value: 'vpc-11a1a1aa'
      op: equal

Likewise, we can also filter SG references by their description.
For example, we can prevent egress rules from referencing any
SGs that have a description of "default - DO NOT USE".

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: egress
    SGReferences:
      key: 'Description'
      value: 'default - DO NOT USE'
      op: equal

.. _aws.security-group.filters.ingress:

ingress
+++++++
Filter for verifying security group ingress and egress permissions

All attributes of a security group permission are available as
value filters.

If multiple attributes are specified the permission must satisfy
all of them. Note that within an attribute match against a list value
of a permission we default to or.

If a group has any permissions that match all conditions, then it
matches the filter.

Permissions that match on the group are annotated onto the group and
can subsequently be used by the remove-permission action.

We have specialized handling for matching `Ports` in ingress/egress
permission From/To range. The following example matches on ingress
rules which allow for a range that includes all of the given ports.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    Ports: [22, 443, 80]

As well for verifying that a rule only allows for a specific set of ports
as in the following example. The delta between this and the previous
example is that if the permission allows for any ports not specified here,
then the rule will match. ie. OnlyPorts is a negative assertion match,
it matches when a permission includes ports outside of the specified set.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    OnlyPorts: [22]

For simplifying ipranges handling which is specified as a list on a rule
we provide a `Cidr` key which can be used as a value type filter evaluated
against each of the rules. If any iprange cidr match then the permission
matches.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    IpProtocol: -1
    FromPort: 445

We also have specialized handling for matching self-references in
ingress/egress permissions. The following example matches on ingress
rules which allow traffic its own same security group.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    SelfReference: True

As well for assertions that a ingress/egress permission only matches
a given set of ports, *note* OnlyPorts is an inverse match.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: egress
    OnlyPorts: [22, 443, 80]

  - type: egress
    Cidr:
      value_type: cidr
      op: in
      value: x.y.z

`Cidr` can match ipv4 rules and `CidrV6` can match ipv6 rules.  In
this example we are blocking global inbound connections to SSH or
RDP.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    Ports: [22, 3389]
    Cidr:
      value:
        - "0.0.0.0/0"
        - "::/0"
      op: in

`SGReferences` can be used to filter out SG references in rules.
In this example we want to block ingress rules that reference a SG
that is tagged with `Access: Public`.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: ingress
    SGReferences:
      key: "tag:Access"
      value: "Public"
      op: equal

We can also filter SG references based on the VPC that they are
within. In this example we want to ensure that our outbound rules
that reference SGs are only referencing security groups within a
specified VPC.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: egress
    SGReferences:
      key: 'VpcId'
      value: 'vpc-11a1a1aa'
      op: equal

Likewise, we can also filter SG references by their description.
For example, we can prevent egress rules from referencing any
SGs that have a description of "default - DO NOT USE".

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: egress
    SGReferences:
      key: 'Description'
      value: 'default - DO NOT USE'
      op: equal

.. _aws.security-group.filters.json-diff:

json-diff
+++++++++
Compute the diff from the current resource to a previous version.

A resource matches the filter if a diff exists between the current
resource and the selected revision.

Utilizes config as a resource revision database.

Revisions can be selected by date, against the previous version, and
against a locked version (requires use of is-locked filter).

.. _aws.security-group.filters.stale:

stale
+++++
Filter to find security groups that contain stale references
to other groups that are either no longer present or traverse
a broken vpc peering connection. Note this applies to VPC
Security groups only and will implicitly filter security groups.

AWS Docs:
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-security-groups.html

:example:

.. code-block:: yaml

        policies:
          - name: stale-security-groups
            resource: security-group
            filters:
              - stale

.. container:: toggle

  

  .. raw:: html
     
    <div class="header docutils container" style=""></div>

  .. code-block:: yaml

    properties:
      type:
        enum:
        - stale
    required:
    - type


.. _aws.security-group.filters.unused:

unused
++++++
Filter to just vpc security groups that are not used.

We scan all extant enis in the vpc to get a baseline set of groups
in use. Then augment with those referenced by launch configs, and
lambdas as they may not have extant resources in the vpc at a
given moment. We also find any security group with references from
other security group either within the vpc or across peered
connections. Also checks cloud watch event targeting ecs.

Checks - enis, lambda, launch-configs, sg rule refs, and ecs cwe
targets.

Note this filter does not support classic security groups atm.

:example:

.. code-block:: yaml

        policies:
          - name: security-groups-unused
            resource: security-group
            filters:
              - unused

        - unused
    required:
    - type


.. _aws.security-group.filters.used:

used
++++
Filter to security groups that are used.

This operates as a complement to the unused filter for multi-step
workflows.

:example:

.. code-block:: yaml

        policies:
          - name: security-groups-in-use
            resource: security-group
            filters:
              - used
